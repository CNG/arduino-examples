# Dancing light filling pole and bike frame

[![Dancing light filling pole and bike frame](/../files/images/bike-888.gif?raw=true "Dancing light filling pole and bike frame")](#dancing-light-filling-pole-and-bike-frame)

This was a project I threw together the night after my 50K race at Burning Man 2016. I adapted the [random patterns](../random_patterns) project to some LED strip I attached to the top and bottom of parts of my bike frame, and then I made a new program for a tall pole that would serve to help identify my bike in a sea of light at night.
