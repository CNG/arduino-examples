# Sound reactive light cube

[![Sound reactive light cube](/../files/images/cube-888.gif?raw=true "Sound reactive light cube")](#sound-reactive-light-cube)

This seemed like a natural project once I learned 8x8 pixel grids existed. I ordered enough to make a cube, and then set out to find a decent way to connect and contain them. I was living in Tokyo at the time, so I went to some craft and hardware stores and found some suitable screws and brackets. I then started taking this and other creations to local bars in Shinjuku and enjoyed watching others interact with the pieces.
