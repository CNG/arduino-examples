# Sound reactive fur coat

[![Sound reactive fur coat](/../files/images/coat-888.gif?raw=true "Sound reactive fur coat")](#sound-reactive-fur-coat)

I built this in 2016 by lining a secondhand faux fur coat with [strings of 50 WS2811 LEDs](http://amzn.to/2aY7OvR) made by Rextin. The LEDs themselves had a very strong factory chemical smell, and the end result was quite heavy. I wish there were a lighter, durable LED string product!
